    <div class="container">

    <div class="freestyle" id="repeat">
    <p>The <a href="#">WWW</a> 
        project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext
        <br> to make an easy but powerful global information system.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="space" id="repeat">
       <p>The project is based on the philosophy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone.
        <br> It aims to allow information sharing within internationally dispersed teams, and the dissemination
        of information by support groups.
        <br><br> Originally aimed at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas 
        and attracted much interest in user support,
        <br> resource discovery and collaborative work areas.
    </p>
</div>

    <h3>Reader view</h3>
    <div class="space" id="repeat">
    <p>The WWW world consists of documents, and links. Indexes are special documents which, 
        rather than being read, may be searched.
        <br> The result of such a search is another ("virtual") document containing links
        to the documents found. <br><br>A simple protocol ("<a href="#">HTTP</a>") is used to 
        allow a browser program to request a keyword search by a remote information server.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="space" id="repeat">
    <p>The web contains documents in many formats. Those documents which are hypertext, (real or virtual) contain
        <br> links to other documents, or places within documents. All documents, whether real, virtual or
        indexes, look<br> similar to the reader and are contained within the same addressing scheme.
    </p>
</div>
    <div class="space" id="repeat">
    <p>To follow a link, a reader clicks with a mouse (or types in a number if he or she has no mouse).
        <br> To search and index, a reader gives keywords (or other search criteria). 
        These are the only operations necessary<br>
        to access the entire world of data.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- <div class="space"></div> -->
    <h3>Information provider view</h3>

    <div class="space" id="repeat">
    <p>The WWW browsers can access many existing data systems via existing protocols 
        (FTP, NNTP) or via HTTP and a gateway.
       <br>  In this way, the critical mass of data is quickly exceeded, and the increasing use of
        the system by readers and information suppliers<br> encourage each other.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="space" id="repeat">
    <p>Making a web is as simple as writing a few <a href="#">SGML</a>files which point to your existing data. 
        <br>Making it public involves running the FTP or HTTP
    <a href="#"> daemon </a>, and making at least one link into your web from 
    another. In fact, any file available<br> by anonymous FTP can be immediately linked into a web.
    <br><br> The very small start-up effort is designed to allow small contributions. 
    At the other end of the scale, large information providers may provide
    <br> an HTTP server with full text or keyword indexing. 
This may allow access to a large existing database without changing the way that database is managed.<br> Such gateways 
have already been made into Digital's VMS/Help, 
Technical Univerity of Graz's "Hyper-G",<br> and Thinking Machine's "W.A.I.S." systems.</p>
</div>

<div class="space" id="repeat">
<p>The WWW model gets over the frustrating incompatibilities of data format between suppliers and reader
     by allowing negotiation of format between a smart browser and a smart server. 
     <br>This should provide a basis for extension into multimedia, and allow those 
     who share application standards to make full use of them across the web.</p>
</div>

    <div class="space" id="repeat">
<p>This summary does not describe the many exciting possibilities opened up by the WWW project, 
    such as efficient document caching. the reduction of redundant out-of-date copies, and the<br> use of knowledge 
    daemons. There is more information in the online project documentation, 
    including some background on hypertext and many technical notes.</p>
</div>

<h3>Try it</h3>

<div class="space" id="repeat">
<p>You can try the simple <a href="#">line mode browser </a>by telnetting to info.cern.ch 
    (no user or password. From UK JANET, use the <a href="#">Gateway</a>).<br> You can also find out more about 
    WWW in this way. This is the least sophisticated browser -- remember that the window-oriented ones are much smarter!
</p>
</div>

<div class="space" id="repeat">
<p>It is much more efficient to install a browser on your own machine. The line mode browser is currently available in source form by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch [currently 128.141.201.74] as 
    <br>/pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z.</p>
</div>

<div class="space" id="repeat">
    <p>(v.vv is the version number - take the latest.)</p>
</div>

    <div class="space" id="repeat">
    <p>Also available is a <a href="#"> hypertext editor </a> for the NeXT (WWWNeXTStepEditor_v.vv.tar.Z), the ViolaWWW browser for X11, and a skeleton server daemon (WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z).</p>
</div>

    <div class="space" id="repeat">
    <p>Documentation is readable using www. A plain text version of the installation instructions is included in the tar file! Printable (postscript) documentation and articles are in /pub/www/doc</p>
