    <h2>Policy</h2>
    <p>This outlines the policy of the <a href="#">W3 project</a> at CERN. 
        Whilst not legally binding, this attempts to explain my understanding of the CERN rules and the desires of the team at CERN.
    </p>
    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>The basic aim of the project is to promote communication and information availability for the High Energy Physics (HEP) community. 
        The project is based at CERN, whose budget is provided by
        <br>contributions of taxpayer's money from the European member states. It is in the interests of HEP, CERN, 
        and the project itself that it should interwork with systems and information in many other fields, and
        <br>so active collaboration with other groups is essential. 
        To produce an information system isolating HEP from the rest of the world would be counter-productive, 
        so the aim can be seen as furthering a global web<br>of information.</p>
    <p>The WWW team are all enthusiastic that information of all types should be available as widely as possible.</p>
    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>We encourage collaboration by academic or commercial parties. There are always many things to be done, 
        ports to be made to different environments, new browsers to be written, and additional data to be
    <br>incorporated into the "web". There have already been many contributions in these terms, 
    and also with hardware support from manufacturers.</p>
