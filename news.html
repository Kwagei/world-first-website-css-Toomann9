            <p>Three developments on the clients side. Tony Johnson of Boston University, developer of the 
                <a href="#">MidasWWW</a> browser for Motif,
                <br> has ported it now to four X11 platforms and has a tar file of sources available on
                <br> ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src 
                or ftp://freehep.scri.fsu.edu/freehep/networking_news_email/midaswww<br> as midaswww_1.0.tar.Z 
                Tony also has plans to include graphics and text editing in the future.

                <p>Here at CERN, Nicola Pellow is back until the end of the year, and has picked up the <a href="#"> Mac Browser</a> .
                    <br>She has a pre-alpha with basic functionality up, watch this space for the first release.

            <div class="freestyle" id="repeat">
                <p>The full-screen client (using curses) has been released by Jim Whitescarver of NJIT, 
                    see <a href="#"> release note</a> for details.</p>

            <div class="freestyle" id="repeat">
                <p>The NeXTStep client has been revised. The 0.13 version generated bad SGML at times,<br> 
                    so anyone using it to write hypertext is advised to upgrade to 0.14 immediately.<br> 
                    The binary is in ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/next/WorldWideWeb_0.14.app.tar.Z</p>

            <h3>More and more hypertext on line</h3>
            <div class="freestyle" id="repeat">
                <p>New W3 servers have appeared at <a href="#">KVI</a> and at <a href="#">CWI</a> both in the Netherlands, <a href="#">IN2P3</a> in France, 
                    and <a href="#">NCSA</a> in Illinois, <br>USA. KVI and IN2P3 are both High Energy Physics institites. 
                    All the servers have local information as well as various other goodies.</p>

            <div class="freestyle" id="repeat">
                <p>CWI has a hypertext version of the Gnu documentation and of a guide to <a href="#">Audio formats</a> , <br>
                    and NCSA has many things including hypertext documentation for the <a href="#">X-Collage</a> system. <br>
                    Two CERN projects to produce online hypertext documentation recently are ADAMO and <a href="#">RD13</a>.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, <a href="#">Cornell Law school</a> have a server with hypertext of US Copyright Law... 
                    as law tends to be mostly cross-reference <br>("as defined in Sect1.2.2.(a) above")
                     hypertext makes a lot of sense here!</p>
